# HOW do we convert to binary?

## Let's follow the below steps to find out

| Description | Example|
|------------|---------|
|1. Start with number you want to convert | 13 |
|2. Divide by 2, write down the remainder | 13 / 2 = 6 **Remainder 1** |
|3. Repeat the Divison until quotient is 0 | 6 / 2 = 3 **Remainder 0** |
| 4. Repeat | 3 / 2 = 1 **Remainder 1** |
| 5. Repeat | 1 / 2 = 0 **Remainder 1** |
| 6. Read the remainders from **bottom** to **top** |**1101** |

## So, our answer is **1101**

Simple as that!
