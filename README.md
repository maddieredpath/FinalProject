# Binary Numbers ... HOW and WHY?
## By: Maddie Redpath

Within this course, we will be discussing different aspects of binary numbers. From why we use them, to how we use them. We will learn how to convert numbers to binary in multiple ways.

This course is dedicated to early learners of Information Technology, or anyone unrelated to the field who is interested in learning a bit more about binary.
