# Now we have a binary number... let's get it back to decimal

| Description | Example |
|-------------|---------|
| 1. Write down the **binary number** | 1101 |
| 2. Label the place values (powers of 2) | 1 × 2³, 1 × 2², 0 × 2¹, 1 × 2⁰ |
| 3. Multiply each binary digit by its place value | 1 x 8 = 8 , 1 x 4 = 4, 0 x 2 = 0, 1 x 1 = 1 |
| 4. Add up the results | 8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = **13** |

## So, our answer is **13**
