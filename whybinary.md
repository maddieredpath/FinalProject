# Why do we use Binary?

## *Computers* use binary because they do not understand the the decimal number system that we use. (AKA: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)

They are the foundation of how computers and digital systems operate. They are...

1. Reliable
   1. Less prone to error
   2. Only has to detect between **on** and **off**
2. Efficient
   1. Works with Boolean logic (AND, OR, NOT)
   2. Straightforward
3. Universal
   1. All digital technology uses binary
   2. Makes it easier to develop and standardize

Now that we know a little about WHY...
